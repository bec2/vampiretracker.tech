  <p style="color:white;">This Brummie vampire reportedly attacked
    locals in 2005. It started with stories of a man being bitten as
    he walked down the street and his attacker pouncing on heroic
    passersby who sought to aid the victim. One woman reportedly
    received a bite to the hand.</p>
  <p style="color:white;">Following this event, multiple reports began
    to pop up around the area - vampire attacks in Small Health, Alum
    Rock, and Saltley. Apparently this vampire wasn’t allergic to salt
    circles. Police were unconvinced by tales of a serial biter,
    remarking that they were likely looking at an ‘urban myth’ gone
    wild.</p>
  <p style="color:white;">A Small Heath preacher, Father Rohan,
    remarked that he was not scared, as he had a lot of crucifixes
    in his house.</p>
