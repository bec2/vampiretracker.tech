  <h1 style="color:white;">Alnwick Castle</h1>
  <br>
  <p style="color:white;">A medieval chronicler wrote of a frightening
     vampire that stalked these castle grounds in the 1100s. The beast
     itself was rumoured to be one of the castle’s old owners, who rose
      from his shallow grave at night to attack townspeople. </p>
  <br>
  <p style="color:white;">The chronicler, William de Newburgh, was a
    seasoned documenter of the paranormal. He did, however, disagree
    with the assumption that the vampire was a lord of the castle,
    instead attributing sightings to an undead retainer of the lord.
    It is theorised by some that he proposed this to avoid offending
    the family who still owned the castle.</p>
  <br>
  <p style="color:white;">An outbreak of plague in the local area was
    attributed to the vampire’s curse, so much so that the townspeople
    formed a ‘pitchfork mob’, storming the grounds and recovering the
    casket from its resting place for a hasty cremation. Upon retrieval
     of the body, the accounts speak of it bleeding fresh blood when
     stabbed with a wooden stake, as if it has been feeding on people
      recently. This further spurred on the frantic, plague-ridden mob
      in their effort to burn the remains. So much for self isolating,
      I suppose. </p>
